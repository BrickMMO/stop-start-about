This website provides a simple stop-start-continue style survey to collect feedabckk from BrickMMO participants.

On the front-end the Stop-Start project will allow the participants to choose the class they are enrolled in and then submit text answers to a stop, start, continue style survey. Responses are saved in the database and viewable by logging into a console.
